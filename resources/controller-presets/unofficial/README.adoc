Here you will find third-party *controller presets* that didn't make it yet into the official Helgoboss ReaPack repository.

== Use ad-hoc

Copy the raw `json` or `lua` file content, open ReaLearn's controller compartment and press "Import from clipboard".

== Properly install as main preset

Put the controller preset `json` files into your REAPER resource directory footnote:[REAPER → Actions → Show action list… → Show REAPER resource path in explorer/finder] at `Data/helgoboss/realearn/presets/controller`.
