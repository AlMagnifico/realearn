/// This is a bit like the Flux pattern. One has commands (or actions) that describe how to change
/// state and the store (in this case the value itself) changes its state accordingly.
///
/// This pattern has been introduced in #492 when changing the change-notification mechanism.
/// We moved from an Rx-based approach where each property has its own subscribers to a more
/// flexible and much more memory-friendly approach that works by letting any property change start
/// at the session and letting the session handle the notification centrally.
///
/// This command pattern is actually not necessary for this new change-notification mechanism. We
/// could also provide simple setter methods that return `Affected` values (as we already do when
/// we apply more complex changes than just changing a few properties). This would have the
/// advantage that we can choose more specific return types, not such a generic one (e.g. `Result`
/// if the change is fallible). However, we introduced the pattern and it's too early to remove it.
///
/// Because it also has some potential advantages:
///
/// - It unifies infallible property write access.
/// - It allows for hierarchical changes without the need for closures, e.g. the command to change a
///   target property p of a mapping m in compartment c is expressed as a simple object! This also
///   has a nice symmetry to the way affected properties are returned (which is also hierarchial).
/// - Because of this unification, we could record changes, log them easily, even build some undo
///   system on it.
///
/// Let's see where this goes!
